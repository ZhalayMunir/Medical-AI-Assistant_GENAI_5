# ðŸ©º Medical AI Assistant â€“ RAG-based Diagnosis System  

This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** powered **Medical AI Assistant**.  
It extracts structured data from JSON-based medical flowcharts and knowledge bases, processes them into CSV datasets, builds **BM25 + FAISS vector search indices**, and finally integrates with **LLMs (Mistral-7B / HuggingFace models)** to provide **clinically informed answers** to medical queries.  

It also comes with a **Gradio Web UI** for interactive querying.

## ðŸš€ Features  
- ðŸ“‚ Extracts and processes **diagnostic flowcharts** and **medical knowledge JSONs** into CSVs  
- ðŸ§¹ Cleans and normalizes datasets (symptoms, risk factors, lab results, history, etc.)  
- ðŸ”Ž Hybrid retrieval using **BM25** and **SentenceTransformer embeddings + FAISS**  
- ðŸ¤– Generates structured and detailed medical answers using **LLMs**  
- ðŸŽ¨ Interactive **Gradio-based UI** with dark theme customization  
- ðŸ“Š Saves merged and cleaned medical datasets for reusability
